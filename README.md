## üõ†Ô∏è Setup & Installation

To get this project running locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd Yabble
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    or if you use Yarn:

    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Set Up Environment Variables**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add your Supabase and ElevenLabs API credentials:

    ```env
    EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
    EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
    EXPO_PUBLIC_ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_elevenlabs_api_key
    ```

    You can find your Supabase URL and Anon Key in your Supabase project dashboard under **Project Settings > API**.

4.  **Set Up Supabase Buckets & Policies**
    The application requires two storage buckets (`avatars` and `cover-images`) with specific access policies. Run the SQL scripts provided in the `docs/supabase_setup.sql` file in your Supabase SQL Editor to configure them correctly.

5.  **Run the Application**
    ```bash
    npx expo start
    ```
    This will open the Expo development server. You can then run the app on an iOS simulator, Android emulator, or on your physical device using the Expo Go app.
